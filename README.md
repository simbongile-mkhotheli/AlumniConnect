# AlumniConnect - Feature Parity & Consistency Guidelines

Welcome to the AlumniConnect project! This README serves as your guide to maintaining consistency, feature parity, and high code quality across all components and modules.

## 🎯 Our Commitment to Excellence

This project prioritizes **feature parity consistency** - ensuring that all similar components, modals, and pages provide the same level of functionality, visual design, and user experience. When you work on any feature, always ask: "Does this match the quality and functionality of similar components?"

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Feature Parity Standards

- **Visual Consistency**: All similar components must share the same design language
- **Functional Equivalence**: Similar features should have equivalent capabilities
- **User Experience Unity**: Consistent interactions and behaviors across the application
- **Code Pattern Uniformity**: Reuse patterns and structures for maintainability

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component/hook has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extend functionality through composition, not modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components can be swapped through consistent interfaces
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces over monolithic ones
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

## 🎨 Design System & Styling Standards

### CSS Organization

- **Consistent Class Naming**: Use descriptive, semantic class names
- **Shared Styles**: Reuse common patterns (buttons, cards, modals)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoints
- **Animation Standards**: Uniform transitions and hover effects

### Example: Modal Consistency

All modals should follow the same structure and styling:

```jsx
// ✅ Good - Consistent modal structure
<div className="modal-overlay active">
  <div className="modal-container">
    <div className="modal-header">
      <h2>Modal Title</h2>
      <div className="header-actions">
        <button className="primary-btn">Primary Action</button>
        <button className="close-btn">&times;</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="modal-body">
      <div className="summary-cards">{/* Summary statistics */}</div>
      <div className="filters-section">{/* Filter controls */}</div>
      <div className="content-grid">{/* Main content */}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 🔧 Development Standards

### Component Development

1. **Start with Existing Patterns**: Before creating new styles, check if similar components exist
2. **Maintain Feature Parity**: New components should match existing functionality levels
3. **Use Shared Hooks**: Leverage existing hooks for common functionality (filters, bulk actions)
4. **Follow TypeScript Standards**: Properly type all props and return values

### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] Component follows established patterns
- [ ] Styling matches similar components
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces are properly defined
- [ ] Custom hooks are reused where applicable
- [ ] Responsive design is implemented
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met

## 🛠️ Tools & Configuration

### Required Tools

- **ESLint + Prettier**: Automated code formatting and linting
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks for quality gates
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing

### Quality Gates

All code must pass:

1. ESLint validation
2. TypeScript compilation
3. Unit tests (where applicable)
4. Visual consistency review

## 📊 Feature Parity Examples

## 🎯 Call to Action

**Every developer is a guardian of consistency!**

When you work on any feature:

1. **Look for patterns** to follow
2. **Maintain feature parity** with similar components
3. **Use unified profile services** (ProfilesService & ProfilesMutationService) for any read/write of alumni profiles to ensure consistent enrichment (impact score, badges) and persistence via mock API.

## 🗂️ Profiles Data Unification & Persistence

### Current Status
- Phase 1: Unified read mapping (`profileMapping.ts`) + `ProfilesService` (completed)
- Phase 2: Admin list (`ProfilesManagementPage`) now consumes unified mapped profiles and displays Impact Score & Badges (completed)
- Phase 3: Persistent mutation layer (`ProfilesMutationService`) with optimistic updates for approve / suspend / reactivate / edit / delete (in progress – core implemented)

### Persistence Layer
Profile writes call json-server endpoints (`/api/users/:id`) through new `MockDataLoader` helper methods:
- `updateUser(id, patch)` (PATCH)
- `deleteUser(id)` (DELETE)
- `createUser(payload)` (POST)
Each write clears the `users` cache so subsequent reads reflect the latest state.

### Usage Guidelines
1. Always read via `ProfilesService.getAllProfiles()` / `getProfileById()`.
2. Always write via `ProfilesMutationService` methods (never mutate raw objects directly in components).
3. Apply optimistic UI updates, then rollback on failure (pattern already implemented in `ProfilesManagementPage`).
4. Invalidate or rely on automatic cache invalidation for fresh reads after mutations.

### Next Steps
- Add integration tests validating that an approve action persists and is visible after a fresh fetch.
- Add batch mutation helpers for future bulk actions.
- Enforce stricter typing of status & role fields (remove `as any` casts).

For more detail see: `PROFILES_UNIFICATION_PHASE2.md` & `PROFILES_UNIFICATION_PHASE3.md`.
3. **Prioritize reusability** in your solutions
4. **Document your decisions** for future developers

Together, we're building not just an application, but a **consistent, maintainable, and excellent user experience**.

## ⏱️ Standardized Timestamps (Mock API)

All write operations to the mock API now automatically manage `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields via a timestamp middleware (`mock-server/server.cjs`).

Rules:
- POST: Adds both `createdAt` (if missing) and `updatedAt` with the current ISO timestamp.
- PUT/PATCH: Preserves existing `createdAt` and only updates `updatedAt`.
- Custom endpoints already setting timestamps (e.g., mentorship sessions, Q&A answers) continue to work; their explicit values are respected.
- Opt-out: Include header `x-skip-timestamps: true` to bypass auto-assignment for a specific request (use sparingly—intended only for data migration scripts).

Benefits:
- Consistent auditing across sponsors, partners, events, opportunities, mentorships, Q&A, etc.
- Eliminates stale `updatedAt` values when editing entities.
- Simplifies UI sort logic (you can safely sort by `updatedAt`).

Next Steps (future hardening):
- Add server-side validation to prevent manual `createdAt` changes on updates.
- Expose optional `?includeMeta=true` query param pattern if we later decide to wrap meta fields differently.

If you create new custom endpoints that persist entities, prefer NOT to manually set timestamps unless domain-specific (e.g., `publishedDate`). The middleware will handle the basics.

- Open an issue for feature parity discussions
- Create a pull request for improvements
- Update this README to reflect new patterns and standards

**Remember**: Consistency today saves hours tomorrow! 🚀
