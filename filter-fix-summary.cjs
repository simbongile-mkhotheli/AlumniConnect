console.log('Changes made to fix the mentorship filters:');
console.log('');
console.log('1. âœ… Fixed FilterOptions interface to include debug property');
console.log('2. âœ… Added comprehensive debug logging throughout filter pipeline');
console.log('3. âœ… Fixed TypeScript errors in filterItems utility');
console.log('4. ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX: Changed useMemo dependency array from [filters, enrichedMentorships] to [filters.status, filters.type, filters.category, filters.search, enrichedMentorships]');

console.log('Root cause analysis:');
console.log('- The filtering logic was correct (verified with Node.js tests)');
console.log('- The React state management was correct');  
console.log('- The issue was that useMemo was not detecting filter changes');
console.log('- Using the entire filters object in dependency array failed to trigger recalculation');
console.log('- Individual filter properties now properly trigger useMemo recalculation');
console.log('');
console.log('Expected behavior now:');
console.log('- Dropdown changes should trigger filter updates');
console.log('- Filter updates should trigger useMemo recalculation');
console.log('- Filtered results should update in real-time');
console.log('- Debug logs should show the full filter pipeline execution');
console.log('');
console.log('To test:');
console.log('1. Open localhost:5174 in browser');
console.log('2. Navigate to mentorship management');
console.log('3. Use status/type filters');
console.log('4. Check browser console for debug logs');
console.log('5. Verify results count changes appropriately');
