# Features Directory

This directory contains the feature-based architecture for the AlumniConnect application. Each feature is self-contained with its own components, services, types, and hooks.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Each feature follows a consistent structure:

```
features/
├── [feature-name]/
│   ├── components/     # Feature-specific React components
│   ├── hooks/          # Feature-specific custom hooks
│   ├── services/       # API services and business logic
│   ├── types/          # TypeScript interfaces and types
│   └── index.ts        # Public API exports
```

## 🚀 Migration Status

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| ✅ Phase 1 | **COMPLETE** | Foundation & Infrastructure Setup |
| ✅ Phase 2 | **COMPLETE** | Types Migration |
| ✅ Phase 3 | **COMPLETE** | Services Migration |
| ✅ Phase 4 | **COMPLETE** | Components Migration |
| ✅ Phase 5 | **COMPLETE** | Hooks Migration |
| ⏳ Phase 6 | **PENDING** | Testing & Cleanup |
| ⏳ Phase 7 | **PENDING** | Validation & Hardening |

### 🎉 Completed Migration Achievements

**Phase 1-5 Complete** (September 21, 2025)
- ✅ **8 Feature Domains** fully established with complete directory structure
- ✅ **TypeScript Path Aliases** configured and operational (`@features/*`, `@shared/*`)
- ✅ **Type System Modernized** with domain-specific interfaces and comprehensive form types
- ✅ **Services Layer Migrated** - All 8 services moved to feature-based architecture with shared infrastructure
- ✅ **Components Migrated** - Feature-specific components moved to respective domains
- ✅ **Hooks Migrated** - Custom hooks organized by feature domain with shared utilities
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility Maintained** - Legacy imports still work during transition
- ✅ **Mock Server Integration** - API endpoints working with feature-based data flow

## 📁 Feature Domains

### Core Features
- **Events** - Event management and upcoming events
- **Chapters** - Chapter management and analytics
- **Sponsors** - Sponsor management and partnerships
- **Mentorship** - Mentorship programs and sessions

### Extended Features
- **Opportunities** - Job and collaboration opportunities
- **QA** - Q&A system and knowledge base
- **Profiles** - User profile management and analytics
- **Spotlights** - Member spotlights and achievements

## 🎯 Import Patterns

### Recommended Usage

```typescript
// ✅ Import from feature root (preferred)
import { EventsService, Event } from '@features/events';

// ✅ Import specific modules when needed
import { EventsModal } from '@features/events/components';
import { useEvents } from '@features/events/hooks';

// ✅ Import multiple features
import { Events, Chapters } from '@features';
```

### Path Aliases Available

- `@features/*` - Access to feature modules
- `@shared/*` - Shared components and utilities
- `@services/*` - Legacy services (during migration)
- `@types/*` - Legacy types (during migration)

## 🔄 Migration Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **During Migration**: Use legacy imports until explicitly migrated
2. **After Migration**: Update imports to use feature-based paths
3. **New Features**: Always use feature-based architecture

### Import Strategy During Migration

```typescript
// During migration - both patterns work
import { Event } from 'src/types'; // Legacy (still works)
import { Event } from '@features/events'; // New (after migration)

// After migration complete - only new pattern
import { Event } from '@features/events'; // ✅ Only way
```

## 🛡️ Feature Boundaries

Each feature should:
- ✅ Be self-contained with minimal cross-feature dependencies
- ✅ Export a clean public API through its index.ts
- ✅ Keep internal implementation details private
- ✅ Follow consistent patterns across all features

Cross-feature communication should happen through:
- Well-defined public APIs
- Shared services layer
- Event system (when needed)
- Shared state management (contexts)

## 📋 Testing Strategy

Each feature includes:
- Unit tests for services and hooks
- Component tests for React components
- Integration tests for feature workflows
- Type tests for TypeScript interfaces

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature directory structure
2. Define types in `types/index.ts`
3. Implement services in `services/index.ts`
4. Create components in `components/index.ts`
5. Add hooks in `hooks/index.ts`
6. Export public API in root `index.ts`

### Modifying Existing Features
1. Update relevant feature module
2. Ensure backward compatibility during migration
3. Update tests
4. Update documentation
